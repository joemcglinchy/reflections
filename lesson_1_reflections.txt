How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-It showed exactly where a line was changed between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can see your changes over time, which is useful for reverting back to working versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing gives you more fine grained control on when you make and submit changes,
    however, you need to be aware and responsible for when you submit changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files gives a snapshot of the project in the repository. Google Docs, you tend not to save inter-related files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show you the commit messages, and you can use git diff to compare different versions by using git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can (usually) always go back!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
